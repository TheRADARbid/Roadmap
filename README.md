# TheRadar – Weekly Update  
**Status:** In Development (Beta)  
**Timeline:** June 30 – July 6, 2025  

## What We're Building  
**TheRadar** is a real-time intelligence dashboard for tracking AI agents, token movements, and subnet activity across the TAO (Bittensor) ecosystem. Inspired by platforms like WhaleIntel, TheRadar aims to make on-chain TAO data accessible and actionable.

This project is currently in its early development phase with a focus on transparency, performance, and real-time insights.

## Week 1 Focus: API Integration  
We are currently in **Week 1** of development, with a focus on backend infrastructure and data integration.

### Goals for This Week
- Fetch live ecosystem data from:
  - taostats.io
  - Creator.bid
  - taomarketcap.com  
- Normalize data: token price, agent performance, market cap, subnet usage  
- Build internal backend endpoints:
  - `/top-agents`
  - `/market-overview`
  - `/ecosystem-stats`
- Connect backend data with frontend components  
- Implement data caching to reduce latency and load time

### Expected by July 6
A working backend API that feeds **live TAO data** into the frontend dashboard, enabling real-time tracking of agents, token activity, and ecosystem performance.

## Live Preview (In Development)
*The following interface is a temporary preview. Full release will follow once API integration is completed.*

## Upcoming
Once backend integration is stable, the next phase will focus on:
- Intelligence layer (top gainers, on-chain alerts)  
- UI polishing and mobile optimization  
- Public beta deployment on Vercel or Railway

## Stay Connected  
We are documenting progress week-by-week and welcome feedback and ideas from the community.
